        <h4 >ABOUT US!</h4>

        <p> If engendering trust is the objective of this page then they’ve got it spot on.
            Bold statements disguised as headings focus on transparency and outcomes, 
            a refreshing approach shared in a visually effective way. Their USP is clear in the space of just five words.
            The design and content mirror their mission: simple yet effective. The usual corporate information is all there,
            creatively packaged into meaningful bite-sized chunks making it easily digestible and shouting out to the Millennial audience.
            The use of mixed images – modern-day icons scattered amongst portrait-like pictures are a million miles away 
            from the traditional charity look and feel which helps set them apart from the traditional model reminding 
            you of their USP. </p>

        <h4>OBJECTIVE!</h4>
        <p>We live in a world where both kinds of people live, the people who spend their lives lavishly and the people 
            who hardly get three meals a day. The second kind of people cannot even afford the basic requirements. 
            One cannot make these kinds of people sumptuous but at least ease them by lending a helping them.
             We can assist the poor to achieve the essentials of life. We live in a world which is full of humanitarian needs; 
             numerous people are dying of hunger every minute. Helping a single person to get food to eat and place to live can
              bring wonders to their life. In Bible, Jesus Says “Whatever you have done to one of the least of these my brothers
               and sisters, you have done it to me.”  </p>
